# 2. Design

## Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme a minimalistic colour scheme was chosen but with a bright red to generate an emotional response. Red is a colour of boldness vigour and stimulation. Red was also was inspired from the spartan helmet used for the company logo which goes with the warrior theme, meant to motivate people. A variation of yellow was also added to the colour palette which is the colour of energy. Coolors was then used to create a palette.

## Logo and fonts

The warrior helment logo was created in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and the white colour for a minimalistic design and to be able to convert it into an svg to achieve the transparent navigation. [Convertio](https://convertio.co/png-svg/) was then used to convert the png logo into an svg.

The fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and Mukta font was used in the headings to give it a minimalistic and easy to read font.

## Structure

The page is structured in an easy to use and intuitive way and it's designed to be user friendly. The website has a Homepage and 4 other pages: Gym, Classes, Prices and Contact Us.

* Homepage - Landing page with an introduction to the gym, including opening times and location; brief overview of services offered and links to them
* Gym - Provides more information about the Gym facilities and a gallery of the actual gym
* Classes - Provides more information about the classes offered, personal training and the classes schedule 
* Prices - Provides information about the membership types 
* Contact Us - Provides information about gym location, opening times and allows the user to contact the gym or sign up for a membership

### Navigation
* All pages feature a navigation, the homepage has a transparent one and all the other ones have the dark one as it was difficult from accessibility perspective to keep it transparent when it came to contrast issues
* The navigation bar helps the user find easily whichever section he's interested in
* When it shrink the navigation turns into a drop-down one for tablets and mobiles
* Navigation used stays into place, a sticky one has not been chosen as the website is not large and the links from navigation are repeated in the footer

### Callout buttons
* Callout buttons have been used throughout the website in order to prompt the user to either sign up or contact the gym and a red colour has been used to make it stand out from everything else.
