# 2. Design

## Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme a minimalistic colour scheme was chosen but with a bright red to generate an emotional response. Red is a colour of boldness vigour and stimulation. Red was also was inspired from the spartan helmet used for the company logo which goes with the warrior theme, meant to motivate people. A variation of yellow was also added to the colour palette which is the colour of energy. Coolors was then used to create a palette.

## Logo and typography

The warrior helment logo was created in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and the white colour for a minimalistic design and to be able to convert it into an svg to achieve the transparent navigation. [Convertio](https://convertio.co/png-svg/) was then used to convert the png logo into an svg.
