# 3. Design

## Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme a minimalistic colour scheme was chosen but with a bright red to generate an emotional response. Red is a colour of boldness vigour and stimulation. Red was also was inspired from the spartan helmet used for the company logo which goes with the warrior theme, meant to motivate people. A variation of yellow was also added to the colour palette which is the colour of energy. Coolors was then used to create a palette. 

![colour palette](/assets/images/colour-palette.png)

## Logo and fonts

The warrior helment logo was created in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and the white colour for a minimalistic design and to be able to convert it into an svg to achieve the transparent navigation. [Convertio](https://convertio.co/png-svg/) was then used to convert the png logo into an svg.

The fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and Mukta font was used in the headings to give it a minimalistic and easy to read font.

## Mockup

* A mockup image has been added to this file to give an idea of the way the website is displayed on different devices which can be found at the top of this page. [UI Dev](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) has been used to achieve this.


# 4. Features

## Curent Features
* All current features have been designed with a mobile first approach meaning the website is fully responsive on all screen sizes.
* Bootstrap grid system has been used to achieve this and custom CSS added to it to make some other tweaks to make sure everything looks good on all screens
* The website contains 6 pages (including the 404 page) and 17 features

### Navigation
* All pages feature a navigation, the homepage has a transparent one and all the other ones have the dark one as it was difficult from accessibility perspective to keep it transparent when it came to contrast issues
* The navigation bar helps the user find easily whichever section he's interested in
* When it shrinks the navigation turns into a drop-down one for tablets and mobiles
* Navigation used stays into place, a sticky one has not been chosen as the website is not large and the links from navigation are repeated in the footer
* User stories covered: 1
