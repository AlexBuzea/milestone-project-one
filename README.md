# 2. Design

## Colour Scheme

For the colour scheme a minimalistic colour scheme was chosen but with a bright red to generate an emotional response. Red is a colour of boldness vigour and stimulation. Red was also was inspired from the spartan helmet used for the company logo which goes with the warrior theme, meant to motivate people. A variation of yellow was also added to the colour palette which is the colour of energy. Coolors was then used to create a palette. 

![colour palette](/assets/images/colour-palette.png)

## Logo and fonts

The warrior helment logo was created in [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and the white colour for a minimalistic design and to be able to convert it into an svg to achieve the transparent navigation. [Convertio](https://convertio.co/png-svg/) was then used to convert the png logo into an svg.

The fonts were imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and Mukta font was used in the headings to give it a minimalistic and easy to read font.

## Mockup

* A mockup image has been added to this file to give an idea of the way the website is displayed on different devices which can be found at the top of this page. [UI Dev](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) has been used to achieve this.


# 3. Features

## Curent Features
* All current features have been designed with a mobile first approach meaning the website is fully responsive on all screen sizes.
* Bootstrap grid system has been used to achieve this and custom CSS added to it to make some other tweaks to make sure everything looks good on all screens

## Interactive Features
* A Google Maps iFrame has been added on Homepage and Contact page which shows the users the location of the gym
* Links on the homepage have been added via images which directs users to the wanted sections
* A form has been added in the Contact page which users can use to sign up or contact the gym
* Videos have been added in the classes page via iFrames which allows users to start, pause and adjust volume as wanted
* Navbar is responsive and turns into a dropdown navbar on tablets and mobile

## Future Features
* A payment feature that allows users to pay for their membership is something that could be added later on which would make a more convenient user experience and conversion for the business as well


### Navigation
* All pages feature a navigation, the homepage has a transparent one and all the other ones have the dark one as it was difficult from accessibility perspective to keep it transparent when it came to contrast issues
* The navigation bar helps the user find easily whichever section he's interested in
* When it shrink the navigation turns into a drop-down one for tablets and mobiles
* Navigation used stays into place, a sticky one has not been chosen as the website is not large and the links from navigation are repeated in the footer

![navigation mobile](/assets/images/structure/navigation-mobile.PNG)


### Callout buttons
* Callout buttons have been used throughout the website in order to prompt the user to either sign up or contact the gym and a red colour has been used to make it stand out from everything else.

![callout button](/assets/images/structure/callout-button.PNG)

### Headings
* All pages have a heading which features as an quick introduction to the page or as a callout to sign up.

![heading](/assets/images/structure/heading.PNG)

### Footer

![footer](/assets/images/structure/footer.PNG)

### 404 Page
* A 404 page has been added in case the user mistypes something on the website which will allow them to go back the homepage. It features the navigation, social media links and a button to take them back to the homepage.
